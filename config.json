On the other hand, there are challenges in implementing existing targets to national policies, which could lead to a delay in achieving the targets and possibly a rollback of existing national targets.<p>On the Decarbonization Observatory, users can explore ways of enhancing and delaying target(s) by selecting pledges globally or for a country. Their impacts on the greenhouse gas emission and global-mean temperature pathways will be presented in different colors.

The emission and temperature data are publicly available in spreadsheets, with all assumptions explicitly stated. Temperature calculations are based on a simple yet well-established method that can be traced back in the spreadsheet.<p>It is important to note that our future scenarios are intended to be used to explore the emission and temperature outcomes of national targets. Future scenarios therefore only consider historical emissions and national climate targets as stated in NDCs and LTSs, without taking into account other aspects, such as the long-term changes in population and global domestic production, and also without interpretating their actual feasibility.<p>If you have any questions, please contact: <u>katsumasa.tanaka at lsce.ipsl.fr</u>, <u>kushal.tibrewal at lsce.ipsl.fr</u>, <u>olivier.boucher at ipsl.fr</u>, and <u>philippe.ciais at lsce.ipsl.fr</u><p>Acknowledgments: Horizon Europe Edu4Climate project (N° 101071247), Horizon 2020 EMME-CARE project (N° 856612), and French ANR PRATO project (MOPGA program; ANR-19-MPGA-0008)"
