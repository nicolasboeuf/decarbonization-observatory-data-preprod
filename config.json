On the other hand, there are challenges in implementing existing targets to national policies, which could lead to a delay in achieving the targets and possibly a rollback of existing national targets.<br><br>On the Decarbonization Observatory, you can explore ways of enhancing and delaying target(s) by selecting pledges globally or for a country. Their impacts on greenhouse gas emissions and global-mean temperatures will be presented in different colors. You can find the descriptions of the pledges by moving the pointer to the question mark beside each pledge."
