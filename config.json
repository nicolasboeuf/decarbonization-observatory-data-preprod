To assess the impact of potential future climate pledges, we propose a simple, transparent framework for developing emission and temperature scenarios by country.<br><br>We show that current pledges with unconditional targets lead to global warming of 1.96 (1.39-2.6)°C by 2100. Further warming could be limited through i) commitment to mid-century net-zero targets for all countries and earlier net-zero targets for developed countries, ii) <a href='https:mylink.com'>enhancement of the Global Methane Pledge</a>, and iii) ambitious implementation of the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use.<br><br>Our analysis further shows that overshooting 1.5°C is unavoidable, even with supplementary climate engineering strategies, suggesting the need for strategies to limit further overshoot and ultimately reduce the warming towards 1.5°C."
